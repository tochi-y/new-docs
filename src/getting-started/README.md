If you want to use main Personium's APIs now, you can request a demo cell that we already set up.
To request, please join our [Slack community](https://bit.ly/Join_Personium_Slack) and give a message to the #demo-cell-request channel.

By this way, you could skip step 1. And you can touch demo apps and start step 3 soon.
