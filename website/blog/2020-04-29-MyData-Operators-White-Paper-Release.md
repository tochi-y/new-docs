Today, we are celebrating Personium’s involvement in MyData Global’s recently published paper, **Understanding MyData Operators**. It is a foundational step on a roadmap towards a human centric personal data infrastructure that involved 34 experts and was supported by 48 personal data operators in 15 countries. The MyData vision published in 2015, describes operators as actors in personal data ecosystems that provide infrastructure for **human-centric personal data management and governance**. Personium is one such organisation and prides itself on its contribution to the creation of sustainable ecosystems where the use of data is transparent and controlled by individuals. As providers of infrastructure for personal data management, we recognise our responsibility in creating **sustainable ecosystems for fair and ethical use of personal data**.  

> “We are really proud that MyData Global has facilitated this landmark paper. **Operator organisations worldwide** have joined on a common journey towards **interoperable infrastructure** for using personal data across digital services. These operators commit to working in a way that not only puts the rights of the individual in the centre, but also sets them on a collective path to build ecosystems that work for people. The MyData operator philosophy is very much *ligned with the recently published **EU data strategy**, which emphasises the rights of individuals in these developing infrastructures.” - **Teemu Ropponen**, general manager of MyData Global

The need for a human-centric data economy is evident: fighting and understanding the impact of COVID19 in a **privacy-preserving** way, and creating better public and private services are just some of the examples. The paper creates a common language, leading to a better understanding of the field and the roles different actors can take. From there, it defines **minimum interoperability requirements** and emphasises the need for **governance**.  

From here on, we will continue to help the MyData Operators Thematic Group in keeping the operators network connected, contributing to thought leadership and working towards **interoperability**, both in **technology, governance** as well as **human-centric** business models.  

> “We have been part of a robust and creative process over the last year with other experts and service providers. The combination of workshops in different places in the world, followed by intense online collaboration in the last few months, allowed us all to contribute to an insightful paper which we support.” - Dixon Siu, Personium Chief Evangelist
