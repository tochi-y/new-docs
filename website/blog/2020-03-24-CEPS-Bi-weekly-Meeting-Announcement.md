A bi-weekly meeting hosted by [Freezr](http://www.freezr.info/)/[OwnYourData](https://www.ownyourdata.eu/)/[Personium](https://personium.io/)   will start on April 1st. We will discuss PDS interoperability issues and try to implement the agreed solutions.  


A Common Endpoint for Personal data Stores ([CEPS](https://mydata-global.org/common-endpoints)) allows sharing apps and exchanging data. With CEPS, applications can be written once and be used with any CEPS-compliant personal data store. In this community meeting we will present the current status of this new initiative and invite others to join for creating a truly open and transparent group in fostering data exchange between Personal Data Stores.
